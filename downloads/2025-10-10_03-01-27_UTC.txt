“Take courage. It is I; do not be afraid.” — Matthew 14:27

Significance:
When the waves of life rise and fear begins to pull us under, Christ reminds us that faith keeps us afloat. This moment on the water isn’t just about a miracle — it’s about trust. Even when the storm rages, His presence steadies us. The same power that walked on the sea can calm the chaos within you.
